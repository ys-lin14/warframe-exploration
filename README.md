# Warframe-Exploration

#### Motivation
I wanted to build upon my previous exploration and see what else I could do with Steam data. 
I primarily wanted to gain experience with databases and sentiment analysis but also ended up
extracting additional information from user reviews and experimenting with polynomial regression.

#### Methods:
- wordcloud
- sentiment analysis 
- polynomial regression
- residual analysis
- cross validation (leave-one-out)

#### Results:
- Stored and accessed data in a local MySQL database using Python
- Visualized user reviews using wordcloud
- Extracted and visualized 'n/10' ratings from user reviews using regex and Seaborn
- Examined user review sentiment using VADER
- Performed polynomial regression on the number of inactive players using NumPy
- Assessed polynomials using residuals and sklearn cross validation
